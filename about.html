						<big>My name is Mandisa Thomas .Born and raised in Philadelphia.I learned to code at NYCDA ( New York Code and Design School ) .There I found out that I like putting projects together and solving problems. Also learned that i have alot of patience which is a necessary skill for a coder. 
						.I enjoy front end development and would like to work on my ux skills. My goal is to work on projects that help to solve everyday problems for everyday people.

							<big>When I'm not code i have plenty of hobbies . You might catch me at a spin class or teaching Bikram yoga on the weekends .I also like to cook vegetarian cuisine and check out new restaruants. As an Anthropology gradaute i love wondering through musuems and traveling. I'm curiously alive meaning I'm a life long learner so i often take classes or read a book about a new subject.</big>
